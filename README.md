Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was was requested by the CEO "Liam" of DriverPass who was looking to create a web based app to help individuals study and prepare for an official DMV driving test. 
They would offer various study tools, exams, and driving tests to help individuals prepare. DriverPass would also offer a plethora of packages at different prices for customers to choose from each with its own benefits.
All of the user progress would be tracked on the application for the user to view on demand.

What did you do particularly well?

I think that I did particularly well on the business requirements document. I feel as I was able to correlate and break down what the customer wanted pretty well as well as what were going to be the challenges on the technical end.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The one area I would revise would likely be my UML diagrams. I feel like I could have been more thorough and included much more detail in their relationship connections as well as covered more customer requests.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I tried to include most of the users requests into the design. However, I feel like some of the features may have been missed during the creation of some of the UML diagrams.
It's important to consider the user's needs when designing because ultimately the project is based on what the client wants and is envisioning. We want to make sure their needs and requests are met so that they are happy with the outcome.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach designing software by trying to first look at all of the required features. I then use various tools (UML diagrams, Process Models, Requirement documents, etc.) in order to get a rough plan for how I want the flow to work.
In the future I would like to further develop my skills using all of these available tools in order help ensure I meet all client requirements.
